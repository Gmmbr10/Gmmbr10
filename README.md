### Hey there! 😄

I'm Giovanne, a software developer based on Brazil.

I'm curious about IT, so I'm always studying it.

I'm capable of developing full-stack applications.

My main tech stack is: React and Nodejs, with integration of PostgreSQL and Docker.
Despite that, I've experience with PHP, Java and MySQL and know Laravel.

I've some public repositories with React and Nodejs because I developed projects and didn't publish them here 😢.

So, right now, I'm creating some projects to publish here.

If you need to send me a message, please send it to my email: [giovannemmelo@gmail.com](mailto:giovannemmelo@gmail.com) or [giovannemdmelo@hotmail.com](mailto:giovannemdmelo@hotmail.com).
